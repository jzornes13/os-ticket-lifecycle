-  Open up another ticket as Ken -> ken@osticket.com -> help topic personal computer issues -> create -> issue summary will be entire accounting department adobe reader not working -> details will be ever since the upgrade nobody can use adobe reader -> create
-  Open one more as Karen again -> general inquiry -> create -> when are we getting a hardware refresh -> details most of my department is having issues with thier tablets, we need these ASAP, please provide information.-> create

Dashboard

-  Now we can make up and answer to "solve" our fake ticket and make sure under ticket status at the bottom click resolved to observe the changes.
-  Notice the ticket disappeared from the dashboard so we can go into the closed tab to find it, click the ticket and see the end result and history of the ticket
-  Pro tip if your new to a job and want to get a leg up or just not feel so lost you can read all the resolved tickets to find out what protocols were taken, kind of issue that happen the most, how they were resolved ect.
